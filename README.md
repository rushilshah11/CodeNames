# CodeNames

Inspiration
My inspiration was playing codenames online with my friends during quarantine until the website was removed. I greatly missed playing with my discord friends and I thought why not make something that allows me to play with my friends.

What it does
This discord bot will allow a group of friends to play codenames on discord with very little setup using very simple commands. This will provide for a very fun experience with the option of even setting up your own word lists!

How we built it
We used replit for hosting and running our bot and made usage of multiple libraries to format tables and whatnot.

Challenges we ran into
Unfortunately, discord does not have a table or any easy way to display all of our words or even any buttons, thus we had to make do with ASCII tables, which would not format correctly unless we made our tables into code blocks. Though not optimal it still allows for fun play. In the future we may look to make this project work with images so that it looks significantly better.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made a game that we can play with our friends, regardless of if we continue working on this project, we can always enjoy a simple game of CodeNames online, something that we couldn't do before.

What we learned
We learned the importance of planning out projects and work division as some people had a lot of extra time on their hands due to ineffective distribution.

Commands:
&red : assigns to red
&blue : assigns to blue
